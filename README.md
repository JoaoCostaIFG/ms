# FEUP MS 2022/23

This repository includes the projects my group developed, some materials to
study for the exams, and the theoretical classes' slides.

## Projects

### 1st Project

This was an extremely simple and small project to learn the basics of netlogo.
This was ungraded and done in a single class.

The [project](./ants/) is an ant colony simulation.

### 2nd Project

My group developed an [high-level python API](https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/TraSMAPy/)
for the SUMO traffic simulator, focused on both simplicity of usage by non-developers
and feature completeness.

You can read everything about it in the
[project's repository](https://github.com/JoaoCostaIFG/TraSMAPy/).

**Grade:** 19
